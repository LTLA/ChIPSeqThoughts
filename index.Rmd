A collection of thoughts related to ChIP-seq data analysis, that didn't fit in the `r Biocpkg("csaw")` user's guide or the `r Biocpkg("chipseqDB")` workflow.

- [Peak selection](peak_selection/peak_selection.html), and why you should avoid _ad hoc_ approaches.
- [Count subtraction](subtract_control/subtract_control.html) for input controls, and why you... shouldn't do it.
- [Non-standard FDR methods](nonstandard_fdr/nonstandard_fdr.html) in `r Biocpkg("csaw")`, and some of their flaws.
- [Low count normalization problems](lowcount_norm/lowcount_norm.html), motivating the binning or filtering methods in `r Biocpkg("csaw")` analyses.
